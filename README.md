## What is Redux?

A single **store** holds all the **state**, which is immutable. When you need to modify some state
you **dispatch** an **action**. Then a **reducer** creates a new copy of the state, with the desired
changes. Your widgets are **connected** to the store (through **store-connectors** and **
view-models**), so they know that the state changed, and rebuild as needed.

<br>

## Why use this Redux version over others?

Plain vanilla Redux is too low-level, which makes it very flexible but results in a lot of
boilerplate, and a steep learning curve.

Combining reducers is a manual task, and you have to list them one by one. If you forget to list
some reducer, you will not know it until your tests point out that some state is not changing as you
expected.

Reducers can't be async, so you need to create middleware, which is also difficult to setup and use.
You have to list them one by one, and if you forget one of them you will also not know it until your
tests point it out. The `redux_thunk` package can help with that, but adds some more complexity.

It's difficult to know which actions fire which reducers, and hard to navigate the code in the IDE.
In IntelliJ you may press CTRL+B to navigate between a method use and its declaration. However, this
is of no use if actions and reducers are independent classes. You have to search for action "usages"
, which is not so convenient since it also list dispatches.

It's also difficult to list all actions and reducers, and you may end up implementing some reducer
just to realize it already exists with another name.

Testing reducers is simple, since they are pure functions, but integration tests are difficult. In
the real world you need to test complex middleware that fires other middleware and many reducers,
with intermediate state changes that you want to test for. Especially if you are doing BDD or
Acceptance Tests you may need to wait for some middleware to finish, and then dispatch some other
actions, and test for intermediate states.

Another problem is that vanilla Redux assumes it holds all of the application state, and this is not
practical in a real Flutter app. If you add a simple `TextField` with a `TextEditingController`, or
a `ListView` with a `ScrollController`, then you have state outside of the Redux store. Suppose your
middleware is downloading some information, and it wishes to scroll a `ListView` as soon as the info
arrives. This would be simple if the list scroll position is saved in the Redux store. However, this
state must be in the `ScrollController`, not the store.

**AsyncRedux solves all of these problems and more:**

* It's much easier to learn and use than regular Redux.
* It comes with its own testing tools that make even complex tests easy to setup and run.
* You can navigate between action dispatches and their corresponding reducers with a single IDE
  command or click.
* You can also use your IDE to list all actions/reducers.
* You don't need to add or list reducers and middleware anywhere.
* In fact, reducers can be async, so you don't need middleware.
* There is no need for generated code (as some Redux versions do).
* It has the concept of "events", to deal with Flutter state controllers.
* It helps you show errors thrown by reducers to the user.
* It's easy to add both logging and store persistence.

<br>

## Store and State

Declare your store and state, like this:

```
var state = AppState.initialState();

var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: state,
);
```  

Note: _Your state can be any **immutable** object, but typically you create a class
called `AppState` to help with the state creation and manipulation. I later give
some [recommendations](#state-declaration) on how to create this class. In special, you can use the
<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections">fast_immutable_collections</a> package
when you need immutable lists, sets, maps and multimaps._


<br>

## Actions

If you want to change the store state you must "dispatch" some action. In AsyncRedux all actions
extend `ReduxAction`.

The reducer of an action is simply a method of the action itself, called `reduce()`. All actions
must override this method.

The reducer has direct access to:

- The store state (which is a getter of the `Action` class).
- The action state itself (the class fields, passed to the action when it was instantiated and
  dispatched).
- The `dispatch` method, so that other actions may be dispatched from the reducer.

<br>

### Sync Reducer

If you want to do some synchronous work, simply declare the reducer to return `AppState?`, then
change the state and return it.

For example, let's start with a simple action to increment a counter by some value:

```
class IncrementAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  final int amount;

  IncrementAction({this.amount});

  @override
  AppState? reduce() {
	return state.copy(counter: state.counter + amount));
  }
}
```

This action is dispatched like this:

```
store.dispatch(IncrementAction(amount: 3));
```

Note the reducer above has direct access to both the counter state (`state.counter`)
and to the action state (the field `amount`).

We will show you later how to easily test sync reducers, using the **StoreTester**.

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart">
Increment Example</a>.

<br>

### Async Reducer

If you want to do some asynchronous work, simply declare the reducer to return `Future<AppState?>`
then change the state and return it. There is no need of any "middleware", like for other Redux
versions.

Note: In IntelliJ, to convert the reducer from sync to async, press `Alt+ENTER` and
select `Convert to async function body`.

As an example, suppose you want to increment a counter by a value you get from the database. The
database access is async, so you must use an async reducer:

```
class QueryAndIncrementAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  @override
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async {
	int value = await getAmount();
	return state.copy(counter: state.counter + value));
  }
}
```

This action is dispatched like this:

```
store.dispatch(QueryAndIncrementAction());
```

Please note: While the `reduce()` method of a *sync* reducer runs synchronously with the dispatch,
the `reduce()` method of an *async* reducer will not be called immediately, but will be scheduled in
a later task.

We will show you later how to easily test async reducers, using the **StoreTester**.

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_increment_async.dart">
Increment Async Example</a>.

#### One important rule

The abstract `ReduxAction.reduce()` method signature has a return type of `FutureOr<AppState?>`, but
your concrete reducers must return one or the other: `AppState?` or `Future<AppState?>`.

That's necessary because AsyncRedux knows if a reducer is sync or async not by checking the returned
type, but by checking your `reducer()` method signature. If it is `FutureOr<AppState?>`, AsyncRedux
can't know if it's sync or async, and will throw a `StoreException`:

```
Reducer should return `St?` or `Future<St?>`. Do not return `FutureOr<St?>`.
```

<br>

### Changing state is optional

For both sync and async reducers, returning a new state is optional. If you don't plan on changing
the state, simply return `null`. This is the same as returning the state unchanged.

Why is this useful? Because some actions may simply start other async processes, or dispatch other
actions.

For example, suppose you want to have two separate actions, one for querying some value from the
database, and another action to change the state:

```
class QueryAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
    int value = await getAmount();
    dispatch(IncrementAction(amount: value));
    return null;
  }
}

class IncrementAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  
  final int amount;

  IncrementAction({this.amount});

  @override
  AppState reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) {
    return state.copy(counter: state.counter + amount));
  }
}
```

Note the `reduce()` methods have direct access to `state` and `dispatch`. There is no need to
write `store.state` and `store.dispatch` (although you can, if you want).

<br>

### Before and After the Reducer

Sometimes, while an async reducer is running, you want to prevent the user from touching the screen.
Also, sometimes you want to check preconditions like the presence of an internet connection, and
don't run the reducer if those preconditions are not met.

To help you with these use cases, you may override methods `ReduxAction.before()`
and `ReduxAction.after()`, which run respectively before and after the reducer.

The `before()` method runs before the reducer. If you want it to run synchronously, it should
return `void`:

```
void before() { ... }
```

To run it asynchronously, return `Future<void>`:

```
Future<void> before() async { ... }
```

If it throws an error, then `reduce()` will NOT run. This means you can use it to check any
preconditions and throw an error if you want to prevent the reducer from running. For example:

```
Future<void> before() async => await checkInternetConnection();
```

This method is also capable of dispatching actions, so it can be used to turn on a modal barrier:

```
void before() => dispatch(BarrierAction(true));
```

Note: If this method runs asynchronously, then `reduce()` will also be async, since it must wait for
this one to finish.

The `after()` method runs after `reduce()`, even if an error was thrown by `before()` or `reduce()`
(akin to a "finally" block).

Avoid `after()` methods which can throw errors. If the `after()` method throws an error, then this
error will be thrown *asynchronously* (after the "asynchronous gap")
so that it doesn't interfere with the action. Also, this error will be missing the original
stacktrace.

The `after()` method can also dispatch actions, so it can be used to turn off some modal barrier
when the reducer ends, even if there was some error in the process:

```
void after() => dispatch(BarrierAction(false));
```

Complete example:

```
// This action increments a counter by 1, and then gets some description text.
class IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	dispatch(IncrementAction());
	String description = await read(Uri.http("numbersapi.com","${state.counter}");
	return state.copy(description: description);
  }

  void before() => dispatch(BarrierAction(true));

  void after() => dispatch(BarrierAction(false));
}
```

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_before_and_after.dart">
Before and After Example</a>.

#### Wrapping the reducer

You may wrap the reducer to allow for some pre or post-processing. For example, suppose you want to
abort the reducer if the state changed since while the reducer was running:

```
Reducer<St> wrapReduce(Reducer<St> reduce) => () async {
   var oldState = state; // Remember: `state` is a getter for the current state.
   AppState newState = await reduce(); // This may take some time, and meanwhile the state may change. 
   return identical(oldState, state) ? newState : null;
};
```

#### Aborting the dispatch

You may override the action's `abortDispatch` to completely prevent the action to run if some
condition is true; In more detail, if this method returns `true`, methods `before`, `reduce`
and `after` will not be called, and the action will not be visible to the `StoreTester`. This is
only useful under rare circumstances, and you should only use it if you know what you are doing. For
example:

```
@override
bool abortDispatch() => state.user.name == null;
```

#### Action status

Although it's unlikely you'll ever need it, you can check if some action finished executing its
methods `before`, `reduce` and `after`:

```       
var action = MyAction();
store.dispatch(action);
print(action.status.isBeforeDone);
print(action.status.isReduceDone);
print(action.status.isAfterDone);
print(action.status.isFinished);
print(action.isFinished);
```

Method `isFinished` returns `true` only if the action finished with no errors (in other words, if
methods `before`, `reduce` and `after` all finished executing without throwing any errors).

A bit more useful is getting this information through the `dispatch` method:

```       
var status = await store.dispatch(MyAction());
print(status.isFinished);
```

For example, suppose you want to save some info, and you want to leave the current screen if and
only if the save process succeeds. Your `SaveAction` may look like this:

```                                      
class SaveAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {      
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
    bool isSaved = await saveMyInfo(); 
    if (!isSaved) throw UserException("Save failed.");	 
    ...
  }
}
```

Then, you may write:

```
var status = await dispatch(SaveAction(info));
if (status.isFinished) Navigator.pop(context); // Or: dispatch(NavigateAction.pop()) 
```              

#### What's the order of execution of sync and async reducers?

A reducer is only sync if both `reducer()` return `AppState` AND `before()` return `void`. If you
any of them return a `Future`, then the reducer is async.

When you dispatch **sync** reducers, they are executed synchronously, in the order they are called.
For example, this code will wait until `MyAction1` is finished and only then run `MyAction2`,
assuming both are sync reducers:

```
dispatch(MyAction1()); 
dispatch(MyAction2());
```

Dispatching an async reducer without writing `await` is like starting any other async processes
without writing `await`. The process will start immediately, but you are not waiting for it to
finish. For example, this code will start both `MyAsyncAction1` and `MyAsyncAction2`, but is says
nothing about how long they will take or which one finishes first:

```
dispatch(MyAsyncAction1()); 
dispatch(MyAsyncAction2());
```

If you want to wait for some async action to finish, you must write `await dispatch(...)`
instead of simply `dispatch(...)`. Then you can actually wait for it to finish. For example, this
code will wait until `MyAsyncAction1` is finished, and only then run `MyAsyncAction2`:

```      
await dispatch(MyAsyncAction1()); 
await dispatch(MyAsyncAction2());
```

<br>

## Connector

In Redux, you generally have two widgets, one called the "dumb-widget", which knows nothing about
Redux and the store, and another one to "wire" the store with that dumb-widget.

While Vanilla Redux traditionally calls these wiring widgets "containers", Flutter's most common
widget is already called a `Container`, which can be confusing. So I prefer calling them "
connectors".

They do their magic by using a `StoreConnector` and a `ViewModel`.

A view-model is a helper object to a `StoreConnector` widget. It holds the part of the Store state
the corresponding dumb-widget needs, and may also convert this state part into a more convenient
format for the dumb-widget to work with.

In more detail: Each time some action reducer changes the store state, all `StoreConnector`s in the
screen will use that state to create a new view-model, and then compare it with the previous
view-model created with the previous state. Only if the view-model changed, the connector rebuilds.

For example:

```
class MyHomePageConnector extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	return StoreConnector<AppState, AppEnvironment, ViewModel>(
	  vm: () => Factory(this),
	  builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel vm) => MyHomePage(
		counter: vm.counter,
		description: vm.description,
		onIncrement: vm.onIncrement,
	  ));
  }}

class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, AppEnvironment, MyHomePageConnector> {
  Factory(widget) : super(widget);
  @override
  ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel(
      counter: state.counter,
      description: state.description,
      onIncrement: () => dispatch(IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction()),
      );
}

class ViewModel extends Vm {  
  final int counter;
  final String description;
  final VoidCallback onIncrement;
  ViewModel({
       @required this.counter,
       @required this.description,
       @required this.onIncrement,
  }) : super(equals: [counter, description]);
}
```

For the view-model comparison to work, your ViewModel class must implement equals/hashcode.
Otherwise, the `StoreConnector` will think the view-model changes everytime, and thus will rebuild
everytime. This won't create any visible problems to your app, but is inefficient and may be slow.

The equals/hashcode can be done in three ways:

* By typing `ALT`+`INSERT` in IntelliJ IDEA and choosing `==() and hashcode`. You can't forget to
  update this whenever new parameters are added to the model.

* You can use the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/built_value">built_value</a> package to ensure
  they are kept correct, without you having to update them manually.

* Just add all the fields you want (which are not callbacks) to the `equals` parameter to
  the `ViewModel`'s `build` constructor. This will allow the ViewModel to automatically create its
  own `operator ==` and `hashcode` implicitly. For example:

```
ViewModel({
  @required this.field1,
  @required this.field2,
}) : super(equals: [field1, field2]);
```      

Note: Each state passed in the `equals` parameter will, by default, be compared by equality (`==`).
However, you can provide your own comparison method, if you want. To that end, your state classes
may implement the `VmEquals` interface. As a default, objects of type `VmEquals` are compared by
their `VmEquals.vmEquals()` method, which by default is an identity comparison. You may then
override this method to provide your custom comparisons.

For example, here `description` will be compared by equality, while `myObj` will be compared by
its `info` length:

```
class ViewModel extends Vm {
  final String description;
  final MyObj myObj;  

  ViewModel({
    @required this.description,
    @required this.myObj,
  }) : super(equals: [description, myObj]);
}

...

class MyObj extends VmEquals<MyObj> {  
  String info; 
  bool operator ==(Object other) => info.length == other.info.length;
  int get hashCode => 0;
}
```

<br>

### How to provide the ViewModel to the StoreConnector

The `StoreConnector` actually accepts two parameters for the `ViewModel`, of which **only one**
should be provided in the `StoreConnector` constructor:
`vm` or `converter`.

1. the `vm` parameter

   The `vm` parameter expects a function that creates a `Factory` object that extends
   `ViewModelFactory`. This class should implement a method `fromStore` that returns a `ViewModel`
   that extends `Vm`:

   ```
   @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return StoreConnector<int, ViewModel>(
         vm: () => Factory(),
         builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel vm) => MyWidget(...),
       );
     }
   ```   

   AsyncRedux will automatically inject `state`, `currentState()` and `dispatch()` into your model
   instance, so that boilerplate is reduced in your `fromStore`
   method. For example:

   ```
   class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, AppEnvironment, MyHomePageConnector> {           
        @override
        ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel(
            counter: state.counter,
            description: state.description,
            onIncrement: () => dispatch(IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction()),
            );
   }
   ```     

   **Note:**

    * `state` getter: The state the store was holding when the factory and the view-model were
      created. This state is final inside of the factory.

    * `currentState()` method: The current (most recent) store state. This will return the current
      state the store holds at the time the method is called.

   <br>

   If you need it, you may pass the connector widget to the factory's constructor, like this:

   ```    
   vm: () => Factory(this),
   
   ...
   
   class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, AppEnvironment, MyHomePageConnector> {
      Factory(widget) : super(widget);
   
      @override
         ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel(
             name: state.names[widget.user],             
             );
      }
   ```

   The `vm` parameter's architecture lets you create separate methods for helping construct your
   model, without having to pass the `store` around. For example:

   ```
   @override
   ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel(
       name: _name(),
       onSave: _onSave,
   );
    
   String _name() => state.user.name;
    
   VoidCallback _onSave: () => dispatch(SaveUserAction()),
   ```

   Another idea is to subclass `Vm` to provide additional features to your model. For example, you
   could add extra getters to help you access state:

    ```       
    class BaseViewModel extends Vm {
       User user => state.user;        
    }
    
   class ViewModel extends BaseViewModel { 
       @override
       ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel.build(
          name: user.name,       
       );                                    
   }
    ```

   Most examples in the [example tab](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/async_redux#-example-tab-)
   use the `vm` parameter.


2. The `converter` parameter

   If you are migrating from `flutter_redux` to `async_redux`, you can keep using `flutter_redux`'s
   good old `converter` parameter:

   ```
   @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return StoreConnector<int, ViewModel>(
         converter: (store) => ViewModel.fromStore(store),
         builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel vm) => MyWidget(...),
       );
     }
   ```

   It expects a static factory function that gets a `store` and returns the `ViewModel`.

    ```
    class ViewModel {
       final String name;
       final VoidCallback onSave;
    
       ViewModel({
          @required this.name,
          @required this.onSave,
       });
    
       static ViewModel fromStore(Store<AppState, AppEnvironment> store) {
          return ViewModel(
             name: store.state,
             onSave: () => store.dispatch(IncrementAction(amount: 1)),
          );
       }
    
       @override
       bool operator ==(Object other) =>
           identical(this, other) ||
           other is ViewModel && runtimeType == other.runtimeType && name == other.name;
    
       @override
       int get hashCode => name.hashCode;
    }
    ```                     

However, the `converter` parameter can also make use of the `Vm` class to avoid having to
create `operator ==` and `hashcode` manually:

    ```
    class ViewModel extends Vm {
       final String name;
       final VoidCallback onSave;
    
       ViewModel({
          @required this.name,
          @required this.onSave,
       }) : super(equals: [name]);
    
       static ViewModel fromStore(Store<AppState, AppEnvironment> store) {
          return ViewModel(
             name: store.state,
             onSave: () => store.dispatch(IncrementAction(amount: 1)),
          );
       }    
    }
    ```                     

When using the `converter` parameter, it's a bit more difficult to create separate methods for
helping construct your view-model:

    ```
    static ViewModel fromStore(Store<AppState, AppEnvironment> store) {
       return ViewModel(
          name: _name(store),
          onSave: _onSave(store),
       );
    }
    
    static String _name(Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>) => store.state.user.name;
    
    static VoidCallback _onSave(Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>) { 
       return () => store.dispatch(SaveUserAction());
    } 
    ```

#### Will a state change always trigger the StoreConnectors?

Usually yes, but if you want you can order some action not to trigger the `StoreConnector`, by
providing a `notify: false` when dispatching:

```
dispatch(MyAction1(), notify: false); 
```

<br>

## Alternatives to the Connector

The `StoreConnector` forces you to cleanly separate the widgets from the way they get their data.
This is better for clean code and will help a lot when you are writing tests.

However, if you want **and you know what you are doing**, here is how to access the store directly
from inside of your widgets (for example in the `build` method):

```
/// Dispatch an action without a StoreConnector.
StoreProvider.dispatch<AppState>(context, MyAction());

/// Get the state, without a StoreConnector.
AppState state = StoreProvider.state<AppState>(context); 
```          

<br>

### Provider

Another good alternative to the `StoreConnector` is using
the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">Provider</a>
package.

Both the `StoreConnector` (from *async_redux*) and `ReduxSelector` (from *provider_for_redux*)
let you deal with widget rebuilds when the state changes.

You may use `StoreConnector` when you want to have two widgets, one to access the store and prepare
the state to use, and the second as a dumb widget. You may use `ReduxSelector` when you want less
boilerplate, and want to access the store directly from inside a single widget.

Please visit the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider_for_redux">provider_for_redux</a>
package for in-depth explanation and examples on how to use AsyncRedux and Provider together.

<br>

## Processing errors thrown by Actions

AsyncRedux has special provisions for dealing with errors, including observing errors, showing
errors to users, and wrapping errors into more meaningful descriptions.

Let's see an example. Suppose a logout action that checks if there is an internet connection, and
then deletes the database and sets the store to its initial state:

```
class LogoutAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	await checkInternetConnection();
	await deleteDatabase();
	dispatch(NavigateToLoginScreenAction());
	return AppState.initialState();
  }
}
```

In the above code, the `checkInternetConnection()` function checks if there is an
<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity">internet connection</a>, and if there isn't it
throws an error:

```
Future<void> checkInternetConnection() async {
	if (await Connectivity().checkConnectivity() == ConnectivityResult.none)
		throw NoInternetConnectionException();
}
```

All errors thrown by action reducers are sent to the **ErrorObserver**, which you may define during
store creation. For example:

```
var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: AppState.initialState(),
  errorObserver: MyErrorObserver<AppState>(),
);

class MyErrorObserver<St> implements ErrorObserver<St> {
  @override
  bool observe(Object error, StackTrace stackTrace, ReduxAction<St> action, Store store) {
    print("Error thrown during $action: $error");
    return true;
  }
}                                                                                               
```

If your error observer returns `true`, the error will be rethrown after the `errorObserver`
finishes. If it returns `false`, the error is considered dealt with, and will be "swallowed" (not
rethrown).

<br>

### Giving better error messages

If your reducer throws some error you probably want to collect as much information as possible. In
the above code, if `checkInternetConnection()` throws an error, you want to know that you have a
connection problem, but you also want to know this happened during the logout action. In fact, you
want all errors thrown by this action to reflect that.

The solution is implementing the optional `wrapError(error)` method:

```
class LogoutAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async { ... }

  @override
  Object wrapError(error)
	  => LogoutError("Logout failed.", cause: error);
}
```

Note the `LogoutError` above gets the original error as cause, so no information is lost.

In other words, the `wrapError(error)` method acts as the "catch" statement of the action.

<br>

### User exceptions

To show error messages to the user, make your actions throw an `UserException`, and then wrap your
home-page with `UserExceptionDialog`, below `StoreProvider` and `MaterialApp`:

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context)
	  => StoreProvider<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
		  store: store,
		  child: MaterialApp(
		    navigatorKey: navigatorKey,
			home: UserExceptionDialog<AppState>(
			  child: MyHomePage(),
			)));
}
```

Note: If you are not using the `home` parameter of the `MaterialApp` widget, you can also put the
`UserExceptionDialog` the `builder` parameter. Please note, if you do that you **must** define the
`NavigateAction.navigatorKey` of the Navigator. Please, see the documentation of the
`UserExceptionDialog.useLocalContext` parameter for more information.

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_show_error_dialog.dart">
Show Error Dialog Example</a>.

**In more detail:**

Sometimes, actions fail because the user provided invalid information. These failings don't
represent errors in the code, so you usually don't want to log them as errors. What you want,
instead, is just warn the user by opening a dialog with some corrective information. For example,
suppose you want to save the user's name, and you only accept names with at least 4 characters:

```
class SaveUserAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
   final String name;
   SaveUserAction(this.name);

   @override
   Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	 if (name.length < 4) dispatch(ShowDialogAction("Name must have at least 4 letters."));
	 else await saveUser(name);
	 return null;
   }
}
```

Clearly, there is no need to log as an error the user's attempt to save a 3-char name. The above
code dispatches a `ShowDialogAction`, which you would have to wire into a Flutter error dialog
somehow.

However, there's an easier approach. Just throw AsyncRedux's built-in `UserException`:

```
class SaveUserAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
   final String name;
   SaveUserAction(this.name);

   @override
   Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	 if (name.length < 4) throw UserException("Name must have at least 4 letters.");
	 await saveName(name);
	 return null;
   }
}
```

The special `UserException` error class represents "user errors" which are meant as warnings to the
user, and not as code errors to be logged. By default (if you don't define your own `errorObserver`)
, only errors which are not `UserException` are thrown. And if you do define an `errorObserver`,
you'd probably want to replicate this behavior.

In any case, `UserException`s are put into a special error queue, from where they may be shown to
the user, one by one. You may use `UserException` as is, or subclass it, returning title and message
for the alert dialog shown to the user.

As explained in the beginning of this section, if you use the build-in error handling you must wrap
your home-page with `UserExceptionDialog`. There, you may pass the `onShowUserExceptionDialog`
parameter to change the default dialog, show a toast, or some other suitable widget:

```
UserExceptionDialog<AppState>(
	  child: MyHomePage(),
	  onShowUserExceptionDialog:
		  (BuildContext context, UserException userException) => showDialog(...),
);
``` 

> Note: The `UserExceptionDialog` can display any error widget you want in front of all the others on the screen. If this is not what you want, you can easily create your own `MyUserExceptionWidget` to intercept the errors and do whatever you want. Start by copying `user_exception_dialog.dart`
(which contains `UserExceptionDialog` and its `_ViewModel`) into another file, and search for the `didUpdateWidget` method. This method will be called each time an error is available, and there you can record this information in the widget's own state. You can then change the screen in any way you want, according to that saved state, in this widget's `build` method.

<br>

### Converting third-party errors into UserExceptions

Third-party code may also throw errors which should not be considered bugs, but simply messages to
be displayed in a dialog to the user.

For example, Firebase my throw some `PlatformException`s in response to a bad connection to the
server. In this case, you can convert this error into a `UserException`, so that a dialog appears to
the user, as already explained above. There are two ways to do that.

The first is to do this conversion in the action itself by implementing the
optional `ReduxAction.wrapError(error)` method:

```
class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  @override
  Object wrapError(error) {
     if ((error is PlatformException) && (error.code == "Error performing get") &&
               (error.message == "Failed to get document because the client is offline."))
        return UserException("Check your internet connection.", cause: error);
     else 
        return error; 
  }    
```

However, then you'd have to add this to all actions that use Firebase. A better way is doing this
globally by passing a `WrapError` object to the store:

```              
var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: AppState.initialState(),
  wrapError: MyWrapError(),
);

class MyWrapError extends WrapError {
  @override
  UserException wrap(Object error, StackTrace stackTrace, ReduxAction<St> action) {
    if ((error is PlatformException) && (error.code == "Error performing get") &&
          (error.message == "Failed to get document because the client is offline.")) 
        return UserException("Check your internet connection.", cause: error);
    else 
        return null;
  }
}    
```

The `WrapError` object will be given all errors. It may then return a `UserException` which will be
used instead of the original exception. Otherwise, it just returns `null`, so that the original
exception will not be modified.

Note this wrapper is called **after** `ReduxAction.wrapError`, and **before** the `ErrorObserver`.

<br>

### UserExceptionAction

If you want the `UserExceptionDialog` to display some `UserException`, you must throw the exception
from inside an action's `before()` or `reduce()` methods.

However, sometimes you need to create some **callback** that throws an `UserException`. If this
callback is called **outside** of an action, the dialog will **not** display the exception. To solve
this, the callback should not throw an exception, but instead call the
provided `UserExceptionAction`, which will then simply throw the exception in its own `reduce()`
method.

The `UserExceptionAction` is also useful even inside of actions, when you want to display an error
dialog to the user but you don't want to interrupt the action by throwing an exception.

<br>

## Testing

It's often said that vanilla Redux **reducers** are easy to test because they're pure functions.
While this is true, real-world applications are composed not only of sync reducers, but also of
middleware async code, which is not easy to test at all.

AsyncRedux provides the `StoreTester` class that makes it easy to test both sync and async reducers.

Start by creating the store-tester from a store:

```
var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(initialState: AppState.initialState());
var storeTester = StoreTester.from(store);
```

Or else, creating it directly from `AppState`:

```
var storeTester = StoreTester<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
      initialState: AppState.initialState(),
      environment: AppEnvironment(),
    );
```

Then, dispatch some action, wait for it to finish, and check the resulting state:

```
storeTester.dispatch(SaveNameAction("Mark"));
TestInfo<AppState> info = await storeTester.wait(SaveNameAction);
expect(info.state.name, "Mark");
```

The variable `info` above will contain information about after the action reducer finishes
executing,
**no matter if the reducer is sync or async**.

The `TestInfo` instance contains the following:

* `state`: The store state.
* `action`: The dispatched Action that resulted in that state.
* `ini`: A boolean which indicates true if this info represents the "initial" state right before the
  action is dispatched, or false it represents the "end" state right after the action finishes
  executing.
* `dispatchCount`: The number of dispatched actions so far.
* `reduceCount`: The number of reduced states so far.
* `errors`: The `UserException`s the store was holding when the information was gathered.

While the above example demonstrates the testing of a simple action, real-world apps have actions
that dispatch other actions. You may use different `StoreTester` methods to check if the expected
actions are dispatched, and test their intermediary states.

Let's see all the available methods of the `StoreTester`:

1. `Future<TestInfo> wait(Type actionType)`

   Expects **one action** of the given type to be dispatched, and waits until it finishes. Returns
   the info after the action finishes. Will fail with an exception if an unexpected action is seen.

2. `Future<TestInfo> waitUntil(Type actionType)`

   Runs until an action of the given type is dispatched, and then waits until it finishes. Returns
   the info after the action finishes.
   **Ignores other** actions types.

3. `Future<TestInfo> waitUntilAction(ReduxAction action)`

   Runs until the exact given action is dispatched, and then waits until it finishes. Returns the
   info after the action finishes. **Ignores other** actions.

4. `Future<TestInfo> waitAllGetLast(List<Type> actionTypes, {List<Type> ignore})`

   Runs until **all** given actions types are dispatched, **in order**. Waits until all of them are
   finished. Returns the info after all actions finish. Will fail with an exception if an unexpected
   action is seen, or if any of the expected actions are dispatched in the wrong order. To ignore
   some actions, pass them to the `ignore` list.

5. `Future<TestInfo> waitAllUnorderedGetLast(List<Type> actionTypes, {List<Type> ignore})`

   Runs until **all** given actions types are dispatched, in **any order**. Waits until all of them
   are finished. Returns the info after all actions finish. Will fail with an exception if an
   unexpected action is seen. To ignore some actions, pass them to the `ignore` list.

6. `Future<TestInfoList> waitAll(List<Type> actionTypes, {List<Type> ignore})`

   The same as `waitAllGetLast`, but instead of returning just the last info, it returns a list with
   the end info for each action. To ignore some actions, pass them to the `ignore` list.

7. `Future<TestInfoList> waitAllUnordered(List<Type> actionTypes, {List<Type> ignore})`

   The same as `waitAllUnorderedGetLast`, but instead of returning just the last info, it returns a
   list with the end info for each action. To ignore some actions, pass them to the `ignore` list.

8. `Future<TestInfoList<St>> waitCondition(StateCondition<St> condition, {bool testImmediately = true, bool ignoreIni = true})`

   Runs until the predicate function `condition` returns true. This function will receive each
   testInfo, from where it can access the state, action, errors etc. When `testImmediately` is
   true (the default), it will test the condition immediately when the method is called. If the
   condition is true, the method will return immediately, without waiting for any actions to be
   dispatched. When `testImmediately` is false, it will only test the condition once an action is
   dispatched. Only END states will be received, unless you pass `ignoreIni` as false. Returns a
   list with all info until the condition is met.

9. `Future<TestInfo<St>> waitConditionGetLast(StateCondition<St> condition, {bool testImmediately = true, bool ignoreIni = true})`

   Runs until the predicate function `condition` returns true. This function will receive each
   testInfo, from where it can access the state, action, errors etc. When `testImmediately` is
   true (the default), it will test the condition immediately when the method is called. If the
   condition is true, the method will return immediately, without waiting for any actions to be
   dispatched. When `testImmediately` is false, it will only test the condition once an action is
   dispatched. Only END states will be received, unless you pass `ignoreIni` as false. Returns the
   info after the condition is met.

10. `Future<TestInfoList<St>> waitUntilError({Object error, Object processedError})`

    Runs until after an action throws an error of this exact type, or this exact error (using
    equals). You can also, instead, define `processedError`, which is the error after wrapped by the
    action's `wrapError()` method. Returns a list with all info until the error condition is met.

10. `Future<TestInfo> waitUntilErrorGetLast({Object error, Object processedError})`

    Runs until after an action throws an error of this exact type, or this exact error (using
    equals). You can also, instead, define `processedError`, which is the error after wrapped by the
    action's `wrapError()` method. Returns the info after the condition is met.

11. `Future<TestInfo<St>> dispatchState(St state)`

    Dispatches an action that changes the current state to the one provided by you. Then, runs until
    that action is dispatched and finished (ignoring other actions). Returns the info after the
    action finishes, containing the given state.

Some of the methods above return a list of type `TestInfoList`, which contains the step by step
information of all the actions. You can then query for the actions you want to inspect. For example,
suppose an action named `IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction` calls another 3 actions. You can assert
that all actions are called in order, and then get the state after each one of them have finished,
all at once:

```
var storeTester = StoreTester<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
      initialState: AppState.initialState(),
      environment: AppEnvironment(),
    );
expect(storeTester.state.counter, 0);
expect(storeTester.state.description, isEmpty);

storeTester.dispatch(IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction());

TestInfoList<AppState> infos = await storeTester.waitAll([
  IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction,
  BarrierAction,
  IncrementAction,
  BarrierAction,
]);

// Modal barrier is turned on (first time BarrierAction is dispatched).
expect(infos.get(BarrierAction, 1).state.waiting, true);

// While the counter was incremented the barrier was on.
expect(infos[IncrementAction].waiting, true);

// Then the modal barrier is dismissed (second time BarrierAction is dispatched).
expect(infos.get(BarrierAction, 2).state.waiting, false);

// In the end, counter is incremented, description is created, and barrier is dismissed.
var info = infos[IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction];
expect(info.state.waiting, false);
expect(info.state.description, isNotEmpty);
expect(info.state.counter, 1);
```

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/test/main_before_and_after_STATE_test.dart">
Testing with the Store Listener</a>.

Also,
the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/test/store_tester_test.dart">
tests of the StoreTester</a> can also serve as examples.

**Important:** The `StoreTester` has access to the current store state via `StoreTester.state`, but
you should not try to assert directly from this state. This would seem to work most of the time, but
by the time you do the assert the state could already have been changed by some other action. To
avoid that, always assert from the `info` you get from the `StoreTester` methods, which is
guaranteed to be the one right after your *wait condition* is achieved. For example:

```
// This is right:
TestInfo<AppState> info = await storeTester.wait(SaveNameAction);
expect(info.state.name, "Mark");

// This is wrong:
await storeTester.wait(SaveNameAction);
expect(storeTester.state.name, "Mark");
```       

However, to help you further reduce your test boilerplate, the last `info`
obtained from the most recent wait condition is saved into a variable called `storeTester.lastInfo`:

```
// This:
TestInfo<AppState> info = await storeTester.wait(SaveNameAction);
expect(info.state.name, "Mark");

// Is the same as this:
await storeTester.wait(SaveNameAction);
expect(storeTester.lastInfo.state.name, "Mark");
```

### Mocking actions and reducers

To mock an action and its reducer, create a `MockStore` instead of a regular `Store`.

The `MockStore` has a `mocks` parameter which is a map where the keys are action types, and the
values are the mocks. For example:

```
var store = MockStore<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: initialState,  
  mocks: {
     MyAction1 : ...
     MyAction2 : ...
     ...
  },
);
```       

There are 5 different ways to define mocks:

1. Use `null` to disable dispatching the action of a certain type:

    ```
    mocks: {
       MyAction : null
    }
    ```       

2. Use a `MockAction<St>` instance to dispatch this mock action instead, and provide the **original
   action** as a getter to the mock action.

    ```                        
    class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
      String url;
      MyAction(this.url);
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => get(url);
    }      

    class MyMockAction extends MockAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {  
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {                  
        String url = (action as MyAction).url;
        if (url == 'http://example.com') return 123;
        else if (url == 'http://flutter.io') return 345;
        else return 678;
      }
    }
    ```

    ```    
    mocks: {
       MyAction : MyMockAction()
    }
    ```       

3. Use a `ReduxAction<St>` instance to dispatch this mock action instead.

    ```                        
    class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
      String url;            
      MyAction(this.url);
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => get(url);
    }
    
    class MyMockAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {  
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async => 123;
    }
    ```

    ```    
    mocks: {
       MyAction : MyMockAction()
    }
    ```       

4. Use a `ReduxAction<St> Function(ReduxAction<St>)` to create a mock from the original action.

    ```                        
    class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
      String url;        
      MyAction(this.url);
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => get(url);
    }
    
    class MyMockAction extends MockAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
      String url;
      MyMockAction(this.url);  
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {                     
        if (url == 'http://example.com') return 123;
        else if (url == 'http://flutter.io') return 345;
        else return 678;
      }
    }
    ```

    ```   
    mocks: {
       MyAction : (MyAction action) => MyMockAction(action.url)
    }
    ```       

5. Use a `St Function(ReduxAction<St>, St)`
   or `Future<St> Function(ReduxAction<St>, St)`
   to modify the state directly.

    ```                        
    class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
      String url;        
      MyAction(this.url);
      Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => get(url);
    }
    ```

    ```   
    mocks: {
       MyAction : (MyAction action, AppState state) async {
          if (action.url == 'http://example.com') return 123;
          else if (action.url == 'http://flutter.io') return 345;
          else return 678;
       }
    }
    ```       

You can also change the mocks after a store is created, by using the following methods of
the `MockStore` and `StoreTester` classes:

```
MockStore<St> addMock(Type actionType, dynamic mock);
MockStore<St> addMocks(Map<Type, dynamic> mocks);
MockStore<St> clearMocks();
```

<br>

### Testing UserExceptions

Since `UserException`s don't represent bugs in the code, AsyncRedux put them into the
store's `errors` queue, and then swallows them. This is usually what you want during production,
where errors from this queue are shown in a dialog to the user. But it may or may not be what you
want during tests.

In tests there are two possibilities:

1. You are testing that some `UserException` is thrown. For example, you want to test that users are
   warned if they typed letters in some field that only accepts numbers. To that end, your test
   would dispatch the appropriate action, and then check if the `errors` queue now contains
   an `UserException`
   with some specific error message.

2. You are testing some code that should **not** throw any exceptions. If the test has thrown an
   exception it means the test has failed, and the exception should show up in the console, for
   debugging. However, this won't work if when test throws an `UserException` it simply go to
   the `errors` queue. If this happens, the test will continue running, and may even pass. The only
   way to make sure no errors were thrown would be asserting that the `errors` queue is still empty
   at the end of the test. This is even more problematic if the unexpected `UserException` is thrown
   inside of a `before()` method. In this case it will prevent the reducer to run, and the test will
   probably fail with wrong state but no errors in the console.

The solution is to use the `shouldThrowUserExceptions` parameter in the `StoreTester` constructor.

Pass `shouldThrowUserExceptions` as `true`, and all errors will be thrown and not swallowed,
including `UserException`s. Use this in all tests that should throw no errors:

```
var storeTester = StoreTester<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
                     initialState: AppState.initialState(), 
                     shouldThrowUserExceptions: true);
```

Pass `shouldThrowUserExceptions` as false (the default)
when you are testing code that should indeed throw `UserExceptions`. These exceptions will then
silently go to the `errors` queue, where you can assert they exist and have the right error
messages:

```
storeTester.dispatch(MyAction());
TestInfo info = await storeTester.waitAllGetLast([MyAction]);
expect(info.errors.removeFirst().msg, "You can't do this.");
```

<br>

### Test files

If you want your tests to be comprehensive you should probably have 3 different types of test for
each widget:

1. **State Tests** — Test the state of the app, including actions/reducers. This type of tests make
   use of the `StoreTester` described above.

2. **Connector Tests** — Test the connection between the store and the "dumb-widget". In other words
   it tests the "connector-widget" and the "view-model".

3. **Presentation Tests** — Test the UI. In other words it tests the "dumb-widget", making sure that
   the widget displays correctly depending on the parameters you use in its constructor. You pass in
   the data the widget requires in each test for rendering, and then writes assertions against the
   rendered output. Think of these tests as "pure function tests" of our UI. It also tests that the
   callbacks are called when necessary.

For example, suppose you have the counter app
shown <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_increment_async.dart">
here</a>. Then:

* The **state test** could create a store with count `0` and description empty, and then
  dispatch `IncrementAction` and expect the count to become `1`. Then it could test
  dispatching `IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction` alters the count to `2`
  and the description to some non-empty string.

* The **connector test** would create a store and a page with the `MyHomePageConnector` widget. It
  would then access the `MyHomePage` and make sure it gets the expected info from the store, and
  also that the expected `IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction` is dispatched when the "+" button is
  tapped.

* The **presentation test** would create the `MyHomePage` widget, pass `counter:0`
  and `description:"abc"` parameters in its constructor, and make sure they appear in the screen as
  expected. It would also test that the callback is called when the "+" button is tapped.

Since each widget will have a bunch of related files, you should have some consistent naming
convention. For example, if some dumb-widget is called `MyWidget`, its file could
be `my_widget.dart`. Then the corresponding connector-widget could be `MyWidgetConnector`
in `my_widget_CONNECTOR.dart`. The three corresponding test files could be
named `my_widget_STATE_test.dart`,
`my_widget_CONNECTOR_test.dart` and `my_widget_PRESENTATION_test.dart`. If you don't like this
convention use your own, but just choose one early and stick to it.

## Route Navigation

AsyncRedux comes with a `NavigateAction` which you can dispatch to navigate your Flutter app. For
this to work, during app initialization you must create a navigator key and then inject it into the
action:

```
final navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

void main() async {
  NavigateAction.setNavigatorKey(navigatorKey);
  ...
}
```

You must also use this same navigator key in your `MaterialApp`:

```
return StoreProvider<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  store: store,
  child: MaterialApp(
	  ...
	  navigatorKey: navigatorKey,
	  initialRoute: '/',
	  onGenerateRoute: ...
	  ),
);
```

Then, use the action as needed:

```                
// Most Navigator methods are available. 
// For example pushNamed: 
dispatch(NavigateAction.pushNamed("myRoute"));
```

Note: Don't ever save the current route in the store. This will create all sorts of problems. If you
need to know the route you're in, you may use this static method provided by `NavigateAction`:

```
String routeName = NavigateAction.getCurrentNavigatorRouteName(context);
```     

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_navigate.dart">
Navigate Example</a>.

### Testing with `NavigateAction`

You can test navigation by asserting navigation types, route names etc. This is useful for verifying
app flow in unit tests, instead of widget or driver tests.

For example:

```         
var navigateAction = actions.get(NavigateAction).action as NavigateAction;
expect(navigateAction.type, NavigateType.pushNamed);
expect((navigateAction.details as NavigatorDetails_PushNamed).routeName, "myRoute");
```

<br>

## Events

In a real Flutter app it's not practical to assume that a Redux store can hold all of the
application state. Widgets like `TextField` and `ListView` make use of controllers, which hold
state, and the store must be able to work alongside these. For example, in response to the
dispatching of some action you may want to clear the text-field, or you may want to scroll the
list-view to the top. Even when no controllers are involved, you may want to execute some one-off
processes, like opening a dialog or closing the keyboard, and it's not obvious how to do that in
vanilla Redux.

AsyncRedux solves these problems by introducing the concept of "events". The naming convention is
that Events are named with the `Evt` suffix.

Boolean events can be created like this:

```
var clearTextEvt = Event();
```

But you can have events with payloads of any other data type. For example:

```
var changeTextEvt = Event<String>("Hello");
var myEvt = Event<int>(42);
```

Events may be put into the store state in their "spent" state, by calling its `spent()` constructor.
For example, while creating the store initial-state:

```
static AppState initialState() {
  return AppState(
	clearTextEvt: Event.spent(),
	changeTextEvt: Event<String>.spent(),
}
```

And then events may be passed down by the `StoreConnector` to some `StatefulWidget`, just like any
other state:

```
class MyConnector extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	return StoreConnector<AppState, AppEnvironment, ViewModel>(
	  model: ViewModel(),
	  builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel vm) => MyWidget(
		initialText: vm.initialText,
		clearTextEvt: vm.clearTextEvt,
		changeTextEvt: vm.changeTextEvt,
		onClear: vm.onClear,
	  ));
  }
}

class ViewModel extends BaseModel<AppState> {
  ViewModel();

  String initialText;
  Event clearTextEvt;
  Event<String> changeTextEvt;

  ViewModel.build({
	@required this.initialText,
	@required this.clearTextEvt,
	@required this.changeTextEvt,
  }) : super(equals: [initialText, clearTextEvt, changeTextEvt]);

  @override
  ViewModel fromStore() => ViewModel.build(
		initialText: state.initialText,
		clearTextEvt: state.clearTextEvt,
		changeTextEvt: state.changeTextEvt,
		onClear: () => dispatch(ClearTextAction()),
	  );
}

class ClearTextAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  @override
  AppState reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => state.copy(changeTextEvt: Event());
}

class ChangeTextAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  String newText;
  ChangeTextAction(this.newText);

  @override
  AppState reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) => state.copy(changeTextEvt: Event<String>(newText));
}
```

This is how it differs: The dumb-widget will "consume" the event in its `didUpdateWidget`
method, and do something with the event payload:

```
@override
void didUpdateWidget(MyWidget oldWidget) {
  super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
  consumeEvents();
}

void consumeEvents() {
  if (widget.clearTextEvt.consume()) { // Do something }

  var payload = widget.changeTextEvt.consume();
  if (payload != null) { // Do something }
}
```

The `evt.consume()` will return the payload once, and then that event is considered "spent".

In more detail, if the event **has no value and no generic type**, then it's a boolean event. This
means `evt.consume()` returns **true** once, and then **false** for subsequent calls. However, if
the event **has value or some generic type**, then `Event.consume()` returns the **value** once, and
then **null** for subsequent calls.

So, for example, if you use a `controller` to hold the text in a `TextField`:

```
void consumeEvents() {

	if (widget.clearTextEvt.consume())
	  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
		if (mounted) controller.clear();
	  });

	String newText = widget.changeTextEvt.consume();
	if (newText != null)
	  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
		if (mounted) controller.value = controller.value.copyWith(text: newText);
	  });
  }
```

the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_event_redux.dart">
Event Example</a>.

<br>

### Can I put mutable events into the store state?

Events are mutable, and store state is supposed to be immutable. Won't this create problems? No!
Don't worry, events are used in a contained way, and were crafted to play well with the Redux
infrastructure. In special, their `equals()` and `hashcode()` methods make sure no unnecessary
widget rebuilds happen when they are used as prescribed.

You can think of events as piggybacking in the Redux infrastructure, and not belonging to the store
state. You should just remember **not to persist them** when you persist the store state.

<br>

### When should I use events?

The short answer is that you'll know it when you see it. When you want to do something and it's not
obvious how to do it by changing regular store state, it's probably easy to solve it if you try
using events instead.

However, we can also give these guidelines:

1. You may use regular store state to pass constructor parameters to both stateless and stateful
   widgets.
2. You may use events to change the internal state of stateful widgets, after they are built.
3. You may use events to make one-off changes in controllers.
4. You may use events to make one-off changes in other implicit state like the open state of dialogs
   or the keyboard.

<br>

### Advanced event features

There are some advanced event features you may not need, but you should know they exist:

1. Methods `isSpent`, `isNotSpent` and `state`

   Methods `isSpent` and `isNotSpent` tell you if an event is spent or not, without consuming the
   event. Method `state` returns the event payload, without consuming the event.

2. Constructor `Event.map(Event<dynamic> evt, T Function(dynamic) mapFunction)`

   This is a convenience factory to create an event which is transformed by some function that,
   usually, needs the store state. You must provide the event and a map-function. The map-function
   must be able to deal with the spent state (`null` or `false`, accordingly).

   For example, if `state.indexEvt = Event<int>(5)` and you must get a user from it:

   ```
   var mapFunction = (index) => index == null ? null : state.users[index];
   Event<User> userEvt = MappedEvent<int, User>(state.indexEvt, mapFunction);
   ```  

3. Constructor `Event.from(Event<T> evt1, Event<T> evt2)`

   This is a convenience factory method to create `EventMultiple`, a special type of event which
   consumes from more than one event. If the first event is not spent, it will be consumed, and the
   second will not. If the first event is spent, the second one will be consumed. So, if both events
   are NOT spent, the method will have to be called twice to consume both. If both are spent,
   returns `null`.

4. Method `static T consumeFrom<T>(Event<T> evt1, Event<T> evt2)`

   This is a convenience static method to consume from more than one event. If the first event is
   not spent, it will be consumed, and the second will not. If the first event is spent, the second
   one will be consumed. So, if both events are NOT spent, the method will have to be called twice
   to consume both. If both are spent, returns `null`. For example:

    ```
    String getMessageEvt() => Event.consumeFrom(firstMsgEvt, secondMsgEvt);
    ```

<br>

## Progress indicators

A **progress indicator** is a visual indication that some important process is taking some time to
finish
(and will hopefully finish soon). For example:

* A save button that displays a `CircularProgressIndicator` while some info is saving.

* A `Text("Please wait...")` that is displayed in the center of the screen while some info is being
  calculated.

* A <a href="https://pub.dev/packages?q=shimmer">shimmer</a> that is displayed as a placeholder
  while some widget info is being downloaded.

* A modal barrier that prevents the user from interacting with the screen while some info is loading
  or saving.

<br>

In the [Before and After the Reducer](#before-and-after-the-reducer) section I show how to manually
create a boolean flag that is used to add or remove a modal barrier in the screen
(see the
code <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_before_and_after.dart">
here</a>).

However, sometimes you need to keep track of many such boolean flags, which may be difficult to do.
If you need help with this problem, an option is using the built-in classes `WaitAction` and `Wait`.

For this to work, your store state must have a `Wait` field named `wait`, and then your state class
must have a `copy` or a `copyWith` method which copies this field as a named parameter. For example:

```
class AppState {
  final Wait wait;
  ...
  
  AppState({this.wait, ...});

  AppState copy({Wait wait, ...}) => AppState(wait: wait ?? this.wait, ...);
  }
```

Then, when you want to start waiting, simply dispatch a `WaitAction`
and pass it some immutable object to act as a flag. When you finish waiting, just remove the flag.
For example:

```
dispatch(WaitAction.add("my flag")); // To add a flag.   
dispatch(WaitAction.remove("my flag")); // To remove a flag.   
```            

In the `ViewModel`, if there's any waiting, then `state.wait.isWaiting` will return `true`.

<br>

The flag can be any convenient **immutable object**, like an URL, an user id, an index, an enum, a
String, a number, or other.

When you are inside of an async action, you can use its `before` and `after` methods do dispatch
the `WaitAction`:

```
class LoadAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {

  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {    
    var newText = await loadText(); 
    return state.copy(text: newText);
  }
  
  void before() => dispatch(WaitAction.add(...));
  void after() => dispatch(WaitAction.remove(...));
}
```                                                            

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_wait_action_simple.dart">
Wait Action Simple Example</a>
(which is similar to the
<a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_before_and_after.dart">
Before and After example</a> but using the built-in `WaitAction`). It uses the action itself as the
flag, by passing `this`.

<br>

A more advanced example is
the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_wait_action_advanced_1.dart">
Wait Action Advanced 1 Example</a>. Here, 10 buttons are shown. When a button is clicked it will be
replaced by a downloaded text description. Each button shows a progress indicator while its
description is downloading. Also, the screen title shows the text `"Downloading..."` if any of the
buttons is currently downloading.

![](https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/images/waitAction.png)

The flag in this case is simply the index of the button, from `0` to `9`:

```                                                        
int index;

void before() => dispatch(WaitAction.add(index));
void after() => dispatch(WaitAction.remove(index));
```                            

In the `ViewModel`, just as before, if there's any waiting, then `state.wait.isWaiting` will
return `true`. However, now you can check each button wait flag separately by its index.
`state.wait.isWaitingFor(index)` will return `true` if that specific button is waiting.

Note: If necessary, you can clear all flags by doing `dispatch(WaitAction.clear())`.

<br> 

If you fear your flag may conflict with others, you can also add a "namespace", by further dividing
flags into references. This can be seen in
the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_wait_action_advanced_2.dart">
Wait Action Advanced 2 Example</a>:

```
void before() => dispatch(WaitAction.add("button-download", ref: index));
void after() => dispatch(WaitAction.remove("button-download", ref: index));
```                            

Now, to check a button's wait flag, you must pass both the flag and the reference:
`state.wait.isWaitingFor("button-download", ref: index)`.

Note: If necessary, you can clear all references of that flag by
doing `dispatch(WaitAction.clear("button-download"))`.

### Using BuiltValue, Freezed, or other similar code generator packages

In case you use
<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/built_value">built_value</a>
or <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/freezed">freezed</a> packages, the `WaitAction` works
out-of-the-box with them. In both cases, you don't need to create the `copy` or `copyWith` methods
by hand. But you still need to add the `Wait` object to the store state as previously described.

If you want to further customize `WaitAction` to work with other packages, or to use the `Wait`
object in different ways, you can do so by injecting your custom reducer into `WaitAction.reducer`
during your app's initialization. Refer to
the `WaitAction` <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/lib/src/wait_action.dart">
documentation</a> for more information.

<br>

## Waiting until an Action is finished

In a real Flutter app it's also the case that some Widgets ask for futures that complete when some
async process is done.

The `dispatch()` function returns a future which completes as soon as the action is done.

This is an example using the `RefreshIndicator` widget:

```
Future<void> downloadStuff() => dispatch(DownloadStuffAction());

return RefreshIndicator(
    onRefresh: downloadStuff;
    child: ListView(...),
```                                                   

Try running
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_dispatch_future.dart">
Dispatch Future Example</a>.

<br>

## Waiting until the state meets a certain condition

The `waitCondition` method from the `Store` class lets you create **futures** that complete when the
store state meets a certain condition:

```
/// Returns a future which will complete when the given condition is true.
/// The condition can access the state. You may also provide a
/// timeoutInSeconds, which by default is null (never times out).
Future<void> waitCondition(
   bool Function(St) condition, {
   int timeoutInSeconds
   })
```

For example:

```
class SaveAppointmentAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {  
  final Appointment appointment;
  
  SaveAppointmentAction(this.appointment);      

  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) {    
    dispatch(CreateCalendarIfNecessaryAction());    
    await store.waitCondition((state) => state.calendar != null);
    return state.copy(calendar: state.calendar.copyAdding(appointment));
  }
}
```         

The above action needs to add an appointment to a calendar, but it can only do that if the calendar
already exists. Maybe the calendar already exists, but if not, creating a calendar is a complex
async process, which may take some time to complete.

To that end, the action dispatches an action to create the calendar if necessary, and then use
the `store.waitCondition()` method to wait until a calendar is present in the state. Only then it
will add the appointment to the calendar.

<br>

## State Declaration

While your main state class, usually called `AppState`, may be simple and contain all of the state
directly, in a real world application you will probably want to create many state classes and add
them to the main state class. For example, if you have some state for the login, some user related
state, and some *todos* in a To-Do app, you can organize it like this:

```
class AppState {

  final LoginState loginState;
  final UserState userState;
  final TodoState todoState;

 AppState({
	this.loginState,
	this.userState,
	this.todoState,
  });

  AppState copy({
	LoginState loginState,
	UserState userState,
	TodoState todoState,
  }) {
	return AppState(
	  login: loginState ?? this.loginState,
	  user: userState ?? this.userState,
	  todo: todoState ?? this.todoState,
	);
  }

  static AppState initialState() =>
	AppState(
	  loginState: LoginState.initialState(),
	  userState: UserState.initialState(),
	  todoState: TodoState.initialState());

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
	identical(this, other) || other is AppState && runtimeType == other.runtimeType &&
	  loginState == other.loginState && userState == other.userState && todoState == other.todoState;

  @override
  int get hashCode => loginState.hashCode ^ userState.hashCode ^ todoState.hashCode;
}
```

All of your state classes may follow this pattern. For example, the `TodoState` could be like this:

```  
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart'; 
import 'package:collection/collection.dart';

class TodoState {    
  
  final List<Todo> todos;            

  TodoState({this.todos});

  TodoState copy({List<Todo> todos}) {
    return TodoState(          
      todos: todos ?? this.todos);
  }             
  
  static TodoState initialState() => TodoState(todos: const []);               
  
  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) {          
    return identical(this, other) || other is TodoState && runtimeType == other.runtimeType && 
      listEquals(todos, other.todos);
  }    
  
  @override
  int get hashCode => const ListEquality.hash(todos);
}
```

<br>

### Selectors

Your connector-widgets usually have a view-model that goes into the store and selects the part of
the store the widget needs. If you have some "selecting logic" that you use in different places, you
may create a "selector". Selectors may be put in separate files, or they may be put into state
classes, as static methods. For example, the `TodoState` class above could contain a selector to
filter out some todos:

```
static List<Todo> selectTodosForUser(AppState state, User user)
   => state.todoState.todos.where((todo) => (todo.user == user)).toList();
```       

<br>

### Cache (Reselectors)

Suppose you use a `ListView.builder` to display user names as list items. In your `StoreConnector`,
you could create a `ViewModel` that, given the item index, returns a user name:

```
state.users[index].name;
```       

But now suppose you want to display only the users with names that start with the letter `A`. You
could filter the user list to remove all other names, like this:

```
state.users.where((user)=>user.name.startsWith("A")).toList()[index].name;
```                                                                                           

This works, but will filter the list repeatedly, once for each index. This is not a problem for
small lists, but will become slow if the list contains thousands of users.

The solution to this problem is caching the filtered list. To that end, you can use the "reselect"
functionality provided by AsyncRedux.

First, create a selector that returns the information you need:

```
static List<User> selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(AppState state, {String text})
   => state.users.where((user)=>user.name.startsWith(text)).toList();
```    

And then use it in the ViewModel:

```
selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(state, text: "A")[index].name;
```                                                                                           

Next, we have to modify the selector so that it caches the filtered list. AsyncRedux provides a few
global functions which you can use, depending on the number of states, and the number of parameters
your selector needs.

In this example, we have a single state and a single parameter, so we're going to use the `cache1_1`
method:

```                                                    
static List<User> selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(AppState state, {String text})
   => _selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(state)(text);

static final _selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith = cache1_1(
        (AppState state) 
           => (String text) 
              => state.users.where((user)=>user.name.startsWith(text)).toList());
```  

The above code will calculate the filtered list only once, and then return it when the selector is
called again with the same `state` and `text` parameters.

If the `state` changes, or the `text` changes (or both), it will recalculate and then cache again
the new result.

We can further improve this by noting that we only need to recalculate the result when `state.users`
changes. Since `state.users` is a subset of `state`, it will change less often. So a better selector
would be this:

```
static List<User> selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(AppState state, {String text})
   => _selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith(state.users)(text);
 
static final _selectUsersWithNamesStartingWith = cache1_1(
        (List<User> users) 
           => (String text) 
              => users.where((user)=>user.name.startsWith(text)).toList());
```  

#### Cache syntax

For the moment, AsyncRedux provides these six methods that combine 1 or 2 states with 0, 1 or 2
parameters:

```
cache1((state) => () => ...);
cache1_1((state) => (parameter) => ...);
cache1_2((state) => (parameter1, parameter2) => ...);

cache2((state1, state2) => () => ...);
cache2_1((state1, state2) => (parameter) => ...);
cache2_2((state1, state2) => (parameter1, parameter2) => ...);
```    

I have created only those above, because for my own usage I never required more than that. Please,
open an <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/issues">issue</a>
to ask for more variations in case you feel the need.

This syntax treats the states and the parameters differently. If you call some selector while
keeping the **same state** and changing only the parameter, the selector will cache all the results,
one for each parameter.

However, as soon as you call the selector with a **changed state**, it will delete all of its
previous cached information, since it understands that they are no longer useful. And even if you
don't call that selector ever again, it will delete the cached information if it detects that the
state is no longer used in other parts of the program. In other words, AsyncRedux keeps the cached
information in <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/weak_map">weak-map</a>, so that the cache will not
hold to old information and have a negative impact in memory usage.

#### The reselect package

The reselect functionality explained above is provided out-of-the-box with AsyncRedux. However,
AsyncRedux also works perfectly with the external <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/reselect">
reselect</a> package.

Then, why did I care to reimplement a similar functionality? What are the differences?

First, the AsyncRedux caches can keep any number of cached results for each selector, one for each
time the selector is called with the same states and different parameters. Meanwhile, the reselect
package keeps a single cached result per selector.

And second, the AsyncRedux reselector discards the cached information when the state changes or is
no longer used. Meanwhile, the reselect package will always keep the states and cached results in
memory.

## Action Subclassing

Suppose you have the following `AddTodoAction` for the To-Do app:

```
class AddTodoAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  final Todo todo;
  AddTodoAction(this.todo);

  @override
  AppState reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) {
	if (todo == null) return null;
	else return state.copy(todoState: List.of(state.todoState.todos)..add(todo));
  }
}

// You would use it like this:
store.dispatch(AddTodoAction(Todo("Buy some beer.")));
```

Since all actions extend `ReduxAction`, you may further use object oriented principles to reduce
boilerplate. Start by creating an **abstract** action base class to allow easier access to the
sub-states of your store. For example:

```
abstract class BaseAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  LoginState get loginState => state.loginState;
  UserState get userState => state.userState;
  TodoState get todoState => state.todoState;
  List<Todo> get todos => todoState.todos;
}
```

And then your actions have an easier time accessing the store state:

```
class AddTodoAction extends BaseAction {
  final Todo todo;
  AddTodoAction(this.todo);

  @override
  AppState reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) {
	if (todo == null) return null;
	else return state.copy(todoState: List.of(todos)..add(todo)));
  }
}
```

As you can see above, instead of writing `List.of(state.todoState.todos)` you can simply
write `List.of(todos)`. It may seem a small reduction of boilerplate, but it adds up.

Another thing you may do is creating more specialized **abstract** actions, that modify only some
part of the state. For example:

```
abstract class TodoAction extends BaseAction {
  
  TodoState reduceTodoState();
      
  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) {
    Future<TodoState> todoState = reduceTodoState();
    if (todoState is Future) return todoState.then((_todoState) => state.copy(todoState: _todoState));   
    else return (todoState == null) ? null : state.copy(todoState: todoState);
  }
}
```

If you declare those specialized abstract actions, you can have specialized reducers that only need
to return that part of the state that changed:

```
class AddTodoAction extends TodoAction {
  final Todo todo;
  AddTodoAction(this.todo);

  @override
  TodoState reduceTodoState() {
    if (todo == null) return null;
    else return List.of(todos)..add(todo);
  }
}
```

<br>

### Abstract Before and After

Other useful abstract classes you may create provide already overridden `before()` and `after()`
methods. For example, this abstract class turns on a modal barrier when the action starts, and
removes it when the action finishes:

```
abstract class BarrierAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {
  void before() => dispatch(BarrierAction(true));
  void after() => dispatch(BarrierAction(false));
}
```

Then you could use it like this:

```
class ChangeTextAction extends BarrierAction {

  @override
  Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	String newText = await read(Uri.http("numbersapi.com","${state.counter}");
	return state.copy(
	  counter: state.counter + 1,
	  changeTextEvt: Event<String>(newText));
  }
}
```

The above `BarrierAction` is demonstrated
in <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_event_redux.dart">
this example</a>.

<br>

## IDE Navigation

How does AsyncRedux solve the IDE navigation problem?

During development, if you need to see what some action does, you just tell your IDE to navigate to
the action itself
(`CTRL+B` in IntelliJ/Windows, for example) and you have the reducer right there.

If you need to list all of your actions, you just go to the `ReduxAction` class declaration and ask
the IDE to list all of its subclasses.

<br>

## Persistence

Your store optionally accepts a `persistor`, which may be used for local persistence, i.e., keeping
the current app state saved to the local disk of the device.

You should create your own `MyPersistor` class which extends the `Persistor` abstract class. This is
the recommended way to use it:

```                       
var persistor = MyPersistor();          

var initialState = await persistor.readState();

if (initialState == null) {
      initialState = AppState.initialState();
      await persistor.saveInitialState(initialState);
    }

var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: initialState,  
  persistor: persistor,
);
```           

As you can see above, when the app starts you use the `readState` method to try and read the state
from the disk. If this method returns `null`, you must create an initial state and save it. You then
create the store with the `initialState` and the `persistor`.

This is the `Persistor` implementation:

```
abstract class Persistor<St> {
  Future<St> readState();  
  Future<void> deleteState();  
  Future<void> persistDifference({@required St lastPersistedState, @required St newState});  
  Future<void> saveInitialState(St state) => persistDifference(lastPersistedState: null, newState: state);    
  Duration get throttle => const Duration(seconds: 2);
}
```                   

The `persistDifference` method is the one you should implement to be notified whenever you must save
the state. It gets the `newState` and the `lastPersistedState`, so that you can compare them and
save the difference. Or, if your app state is simple, you can simply save the whole `newState` each
time the method is called.

The `persistDifference` method will be called by AsyncRedux whenever the state changes, but not more
than once each 2 seconds, which is the throttle period. All state changes within these 2 seconds
will be collected, and then a single call to the method will be made with all the changes after this
period.

Also, the `persistDifference` method won't be called while the previous save is not finished, even
if the throttle period is done. In this case, if a new state becomes available the method will be
called as soon as the current save finishes.

Note you can also override the `throttle` getter to define a different throttle period. In special,
if you define it as `null` there will be no throttle, and you'll be able to save the state as soon
as it changes.

Even if you have a non-zero throttle period, sometimes you may want to save the state immediately.
This is usually the case, for example, when the app is closing. You can do that by dispatching the
provided `PersistAction`. This action will ignore the throttle period and call
the `persistDifference` method right away to save the current state.

```
store.dispatch(PersistAction());
```      

Have a look at
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/test/persistence_test.dart">
Persistence tests</a>.

<br>

### Saving and Loading

You can choose any way you want to save the state difference to the local disk, but one way is using
the provided `LocalPersist` class, which is very easy to use.

Note: At the moment it only works for Android/iOS, not for the web.

First, import it:

``` 
import 'package:async_redux/local_persist.dart';
```

You need to convert yourself your objects to a list of **simple objects**
composed only of numbers, booleans, strings, lists and maps (you can nest lists and maps).

For example, this is a list of simple objects:

```
List<Object> simpleObjs = [
  'Goodbye',
  '"Life is what happens\n\rwhen you\'re busy making other plans." -John Lennon',
  [100, 200, {"name": "João"}],
  true,
  42,
];
```

Then create a `LocalPersist` class to use the `/db/myFile.db` file:

```
var persist = LocalPersist("myFile");
```

You can save the list to the file:

```
await persist.save(simpleObjs);
```

And then later load these objects:

```                                       
List<Object> simpleObjs = await persistence.load();
```

Usually the `save` method rewrites the file. But it also lets you append more objects:

```
List<Object> moreObjs = ['Lets', 'append', 'more'];
await persist.save(simpleObjs, append: true);
```

You can also delete the file, get its length, see if it exists etc:

```                      
int length = await persist.length();
bool exists = await persist.exists();
await persist.delete();
```                            

Note: `LocalPersist` uses a file format similar to JSON, but not exactly JSON, because JSON cannot
be appended to. If you want to save and load a single object into standard JSON, use the `saveJson`
and `loadJson` methods:

```
await persist.saveJson(simpleObj);
Object? simpleObj = await persistence.loadJson();
```

Have a look at
the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/test/local_persist_test.dart">
Local Persist tests</a>.

<br>

## Logging

Your store optionally accepts lists of `actionObservers` and `stateObservers`, which may be used for
logging:

```
var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: state,
  actionObservers: [Log.printer(formatter: Log.verySimpleFormatter)],
  stateObservers: [StateLogger()],
);
```

The `ActionObserver` is an abstract class with an `observe` method which you can implement to be
notified of **action dispatching**:

 ```
abstract class ActionObserver<St> {

   void observe(
      ReduxAction<St> action, 
      int dispatchCount, {
      @required bool ini,
      }
   );
}
 ```

The above observer will actually be called twice, one with `ini==true` for the INITIAL action
observation, and one with `ini==false` for the END action observation,

Meanwhile, the `StateObserver` is an abstract class which you can implement to be notified of **
state changes**:

```
abstract class StateObserver<St> {

   void observe(
      ReduxAction<St> action, 
      St stateIni, 
      St stateEnd, 
      int dispatchCount,
      );
}
```

In more detail:

1. The INI action observation means the action was just dispatched and haven't changed anything yet.
   After that, it may do sync stuff, and it may or may not start async processes, depending if its
   reducer is sync or async.

2. The END action observation means the action reducer has just finished returning a new state, thus
   changing the store state. Only after getting END states you may see store changes.

3. The state observation is therefore called as soon as possible after the store change has taken
   place, i.e., right after the END action observation. However, it contains a copy of both the
   state **before the action INI** and the state **after the action END**, in case you need to
   compare them.

Please note, unless the action reducer is synchronous, getting an END action observation doesn't
mean that all of the action effects have finished, because the action may have started async
processes that may well last into the future. And these processes may later dispatch other actions
that will change the store state. However, it does mean that the action can no longer change the
state **directly**.

<br>

## Observing rebuilds

Your store optionally accepts a `modelObserver`, which lets you visualize rebuilds.

The `ModelObserver` is an abstract class with an `observe` method which you can implement to be
notified, by each `StoreConnector` currently in the widget tree, whenever there is a state change.
You can create your own `ModelObserver`, but the provided `DefaultModelObserver` can be used out of
the box to print to the console and do basic testing:

```
var store = Store<AppState, AppEnvironment>(
  initialState: state,
  modelObserver: DefaultModelObserver(),  
);
```                                      

This is an example output to the console, showing how `MyWidgetConnector` responded to 3 state
changes:

    Model D:1 R:1 = Rebuid:true, Connector:MyWidgetConnector, Model:MyViewModel{B}.
    Model D:2 R:2 = Rebuid:false, Connector:MyWidgetConnector, Model:MyViewModel{B}.
    Model D:3 R:3 = Rebuid:true, Connector:MyWidgetConnector, Model:MyViewModel{C}.

You can see above that the first and third state changes resulted in a rebuild (`Rebuid:true`), but
the second one did not, probably because the part of the state that changed was not part
of `MyViewModel`.

<a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_dispatch_future.dart">
This example</a>
also shows the `ModelObserver` in action.

Note: You must pass `debug:this` as a `StoreConnector` constructor parameter, if you want
the `ModelObserver` to be able to print the `StoreConnector` type to the output. You can also
override your `ViewModel.toString()` to print out any extra info you need.

The `ModelObserver` is also useful when you want to create tests to assert that rebuilds happen when
and only when the appropriate parts of the state change. For an example, see
the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/test/model_observer_test.dart">
Model Observer Test</a>.

## How to interact with the database

The following advice works for any Redux version, including AsyncRedux.

Pretend the user presses a button in the dumb-widget, running a callback which was passed in its
constructor. This callback, which was created by the Connector widget, will dispatch an action.

This action's async reducer will connect to the database and get the desired information. You can **
directly** connect to the database from the async reducer, or have a **DAO** to abstract the
database implementation details.

This would be your reducer:

```
@override
Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	var something = await myDao.loadSomething();
	return state.copy(something: something);
}
```

This rebuilds your widgets that depend on `something`, with its new value. The state now holds the
new `something`, and the local store persistor may persist this value to the local file system, if
that's what you want.

<br>

## How to deal with Streams

The following advice works for any Redux version, including AsyncRedux.

AsyncRedux plays well with Streams, as long as you know how to use them:

- Don't send the streams down to the dumb-widget, and not even to the Connector. If you are
  declaring, subscribing to, or unsubscribing from streams inside of widgets, it means you are
  mixing Redux with some other architecture. You _can_ do that, but it's not recommended and not
  necessary.
- Don't put streams into the store state. They are not app state, and they should not be persisted
  to the local filesystem. Instead, they are something that "generates state".

<br>

### So, how do you use streams?

Let's pretend you want to listen to changes to the user name, in a Firestore database. First, create
an action to start listening, and another action to cancel. We could name
them `StartListenUserNameAction`
and `CancelListenUserNameAction`.

- If the stream should run all the time, you may dispatch the start action as soon as the app
  starts, right after you create the store, possibly in `main`. And cancel it when the app finishes.

- If the stream should run only when the user is viewing some screen, you may dispatch the action
  from the `initState` method of the screen widget, and cancel it from the `dispose` method. Note:
  More precisely, these things are done by the callbacks that the Connectors create and send down to
  the stateful dumb-widgets.

- If the stream should run only when some actions demand it, their reducers may dispatch the actions
  to start and cancel as needed.

<br>

### Where the stream subscriptions themselves are stored

As discussed above, you should NOT put them in the store state. Instead save them in some convenient
place elsewhere, where your reducers may access them. Remember you **only** need to access them from
the reducers. If you have separate business and client layers, put them into the business layer.

Some ideas:

- Put them as static variables of the specific **actions** that start them. For
  example, `userNameStream` could be a static field of the `StartListenUserNameAction` class.

- Put them in the **state classes** that most relate to them, but as **static** variables, not
  instance variables (which would be store state). For example, if your `AppState` contains
  some `UserState`, then `userNameStream`
  could be a static field of the `UserState` class.

- Save them in global static variables.

- Use a service locator, like <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/get_it">get_it</a>.

Or put them wherever you think makes sense. In all cases above, you can still inject them with
mocks, for tests.

<br>

### How do streams pass their information to the store and ultimately to the widgets?

When you create the stream, define its callback so that it dispatches an appropriate action. Each
time the stream gets some data it will pass it to this action's constructor. The action's reducer
will put the data into the store state, from where it will be automatically sent down to the widgets
that observe them (through their Connector/ViewModel).

For example:

```
Stream<QuerySnapshot> stream = query.snapshots();

streamSub = stream.listen((QuerySnapshot querySnapshot) {
  dispatch(DoSomethingAction(querySnapshot.documentChanges));
  }, onError: ...);
```

<br>

### To sum up:

1. Put your stream subscriptions where they can be accessed by the reducers, but NOT inside of the
   store state.

2. Don't use streams directly in widgets (not in the Connector widget, and not in the dumb-widget).

3. Create actions to start and cancel streams, and call them when necessary.

4. The stream callback should dispatch actions to put the snapshot data into the store state.

<br>

## Recommended Directory Structure

You probably have your own way of organizing your directory structure, but if you want some
recommendation, here it goes.

First, separate your directory structure by **client** and **business**. The **client** directory
holds Flutter stuff like widgets, including your connector and dumb widgets. The **business**
directory holds the business layer stuff, including the store, state, and code to access the
database and to persist the state to disk.

```
├── business
│   ├── lib
│   ├── test
│   └── pubspec.yaml
└── client
    ├── lib
    ├── test
    └── pubspec.yaml
```

Edit the `client/pubspec.yaml` file to contain this:

```
dependencies:
  business:
    path: ../business/
```

However, `business/pubspec.yaml` should contain no references to the **client**. This guarantees
the **client** code can use the **business** code, but the **business** code can't access the **
client** code.

In `business/lib` create separate directories for your main features, and only then create
directories like `actions`, `models`, `dao` or other.

Note that AsyncRedux has no separate reducers nor middleware, so this simplifies the directory
structure in relation to vanilla Redux.

Your final directory structure would then look something like this:

```
├── business
│   ├── lib
│   │   ├── login
│   │   │   ├── actions
│   │   │   │   ├── login_action.dart
│   │   │   │   ├── logout_action.dart
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── models
│   │   │       └── login_state.dart

    │   └── todos

```

## Where to put your business logic

Widgets, Connectors and ViewModels are part of the client code. If you use the recommended directory
structure, they should be in the client directory, which is **not** visible to the business code.

Actions, reducers and state classes are part of the business code. If you use the recommended
directory structure, they should be in the business directory, which is visible to the client code.

Rules of thumb:

* Don't put your business logic in the Widgets.
* Don't put your business logic in the Connectors.
* Don't put your business logic in the ViewModels of the Connectors.
* Put your business logic in the Action reducers.
* Put your business logic in the State classes.

## Architectural discussion

Reading the following text is not important for the practical use of AsyncRedux, and is meant only
for those interested in architectural discussions:

### Is AsyncRedux really Redux?

According to redux.js.org there are three principles to Redux:

1. **The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.**

   That’s true for AsyncRedux.

2. **The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.**

   That’s also true for AsyncRedux.

3. **To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.**

   Ok, so how about middleware? It's not possible to create real world applications without async
   calls and external databases access. So, even in vanilla Redux, actions start async processes
   that yield results that only then will be put into the store state, through reducers. So it's not
   true that the state tree depends only on pure functions. You can't separate the pure part and
   call it a reducer, and then conveniently forget about the impure/async part. In other words, you
   have A and B. A is simple and pure, but we can't call it a reducer and say that's part of our
   principles, and then forget about B. Async Redux acknowledges that B is also part of the
   solution, and then creates tools to deal with it as easily as possible. The litmus test here, to
   prove that AsyncRedux is Redux, is that you can have a 1 to 1 mapping from vanilla Redux
   reducers+middleware code to the AsyncRedux sync+async reducers code. The same async code will
   call the same pure code. You just organize it differently to avoid boilerplate. Another way to
   look at it is that at first glance the AsyncRedux reducer doesn't appear to be a pure function.
   Pure function reducers are the wall of sanity against the side-effects managed by middleware via
   thunks, sagas, observables, etc. But when you take a second look, `return state.copy(...)` is the
   pure reducer, and everything else in `reduce()` is essentially middleware.

### Besides the reduction of boilerplate, what are the main advantages of the AsyncRedux architecture?

In vanilla Redux it's easy to reason about the code at first, when it's just pure function reducers,
but it gets difficult to understand the whole picture as soon as you have to add complex Middleware.
When you see a side by side comparison of code written for vanilla Redux and for AsyncRedux, the
code is easier to understand with AsyncRedux.

Also, vanilla Redux makes it easy to test its pure functions reducers, but it doesn't help at all
with testing the middleware. In contrast, since AsyncRedux natively takes async code into
consideration, its testing capabilities (the `StoreTester`) make it easy to test the code as a
whole.

AsyncRedux also helps with code errors, by simply letting your reducers throw errors. AsyncRedux
will catch them and deal with them appropriately, while vanilla Redux forces your middleware to
catch errors and maybe even dispatch actions do deal with them.

### Is AsyncRedux a minimalist or lightweight Redux version?

No. AsyncRedux is concerned with being "easy to use", not with being lightweight. In terms of
library code size it's larger than the original Redux implementation. However it's still very small,
and will make the total application code smaller than with the vanilla implementation, because of
the boilerplate reduction. In terms of speed/performance there should be no differences in respect
to the vanilla implementation.

### Is the AsyncRedux architecture useful for small projects?

It's usually said that you should not use Redux for small projects, because of the extra boilerplate
and limitations. Maybe it's not worth the effort. However, since AsyncRedux is easier than vanilla
Redux and has far less boilerplate, the limit of code complexity where a robust architecture starts
making sense is much lower.
