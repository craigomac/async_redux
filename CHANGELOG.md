# [11.0.0] - 2021/06/02

* Breaking change: The `dispatchFuture` function is not necessary anymore. Just rename it
  to `dispatch`, since now the `dispatch` function always returns a future, and you can await it or
  not, as desired.

* Breaking change: `ReduxAction.hasFinished()` has been renamed to `isFinished`.

* The `dispatch` function now returns an `ActionStatus`. Usually you will discard this info, but you
  may use it to know if the action completed with no errors. For example, suppose a `SaveAction`
  looks like this:

  ```                                      
  class SaveAction extends ReduxAction<AppState, AppEnvironment> {      
    Future<AppState> reduce({required AppEnvironment environment}) async {
	  bool isSaved = await saveMyInfo(); 
      if (!isSaved) throw UserException("Save failed.");	 
	  ...
    }
  }
  ```

  Then, when you save some info, you want to leave the current screen if and only if the save
  process succeeded:

  ```
  var status = await dispatch(SaveAction(info));
  if (status.isFinished) dispatch(NavigateAction.pop()); // Or: Navigator.pop(context) 
  ```              

# [10.0.1] - 2021/05/15

* Breaking change: The new `UserExceptionDialog.useLocalContext` parameter now allows
  the `UserExceptionDialog` to be put in the `builder` parameter of the `MaterialApp` widget. Even
  if you use this dialog, it is unlikely this will be a breaking change for you. But if it is, and
  your error dialog now has problems, simply make `useLocalContext: true` to return to the old
  behavior.

* Breaking change: `StoreConnector` parameters `onInitialBuild`, `onDidChange`
  and `onWillChange` now also get the context and the store. For example, where you previously
  had `onInitialBuild(vm) {...}` now you have `onInitialBuild(context, store, vm) {...}`.

# [9.0.9] - 2021/05/10

* LocalPersist `saveJson()` and `loadJson()` methods.

# [9.0.8] - 2021/04/26

* FIC and weak-map version bump.

# [9.0.7] - 2021/04/16

* NNBD improvements.
* FIC version bump.

# [9.0.1] - 2021/03/22

* Downgrade to file: ^6.0.0 to improve compatibility.

# [9.0.0] - 2021/03/03

* Nullsafe.

# [8.0.0] - 2021/02/21

* Uses nullsafe dependencies (it's not yet itself nullsafe).

* Breaking change: Cache functions (for memoization) have been renamed and extended.

# [7.0.2] - 2021/02/12

* LocalPersist: Better handling of mock file-systems.

# [7.0.1] - 2020/12/30

* Breaking change:

  Now the `vm` parameter in the `StoreConnector` is a function that creates a `VmFactory` (instead
  of being a `VmFactory` object itself).

  So, to upgrade, you just need to provide this:

  ```
  vm: () => MyFactory(this),
  ```

  Instead of this:

  ```                
  // Deprecated.
  vm: MyFactory(this), 
  ```

  Now the `StoreConnector` will create a `VmFactory` every time it needs a view-model. The Factory
  will have access to:

    1) `state` getter: The state the store was holding when the factory and the view-model were
       created. This state is final inside of the factory.

    2) `currentState()` method: The current (most recent) store state. This will return the current
       state the store holds at the time the method is called.

* New store parameter `immutableCollectionEquality` lets you override the equality used for
  immutable collections from the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections">
  fast_immutable_collections</a> package.

# [6.0.3] - 2020/12/03

* StoreTester.dispatchState().

# [6.0.2] - 2020/11/16

* VmFactory.getAndRemoveFirstError().

# [6.0.1] - 2020/10/30

* `NavigateAction` now closely follows the `Navigator` api:  `push()`,
  `pop()`, `popAndPushNamed()`, `pushNamed()`, `pushReplacement()`, `pushAndRemoveUntil()`,
  `replace()`, `replaceRouteBelow()`, `pushReplacementNamed()`, `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()`,
  `pushNamedAndRemoveAll()`, `popUntil()`, `removeRoute()`, `removeRouteBelow()`,
  `popUntilRouteName()` and `popUntilRoute()`.

# [5.0.0] - 2020/10/19

* Breaking change: OnWillChangeCallback now provides previousVm.

# [4.0.4] - 2020/10/19

* Better performance: Less unnecessary view-model calculations.
* StoreConnector.shouldUpdateModel fix.

# [4.0.1] - 2020/10/02

## Flutter 1.22 compatibility

Bumping _file: ^6.0.0-nullsafety.2_

<br>

## Breaking Change

The abstract `ReduxAction.reduce()` method signature has a return type of `FutureOr<AppState>`, but
your concrete reducers must return one or the other: `AppState` or `Future<AppState>`.

That's necessary because AsyncRedux knows if a reducer is sync or async not by checking the returned
type, but by checking your `reducer()` method signature. If it is `FutureOr<AppState>`, AsyncRedux
can't know if it's sync or async, and will throw a `StoreException`:

```
Reducer should return `St?` or `Future<St?>`. Do not return `FutureOr<St?>`.
```

<br>

## Breaking Change

Previously to version 4.0.0, your *async* reducers would have to make sure never to return completed
futures. This is no longer necessary in version 4.0.0.

Now, while *sync* reducers continue to run synchronously with the dispatch, the *async* reducers
will not be called immediately, but will be scheduled in a later task.

Why is this a breaking change? Previously to version 4.0.0, the async reducers would have at least
started synchronously with the dispatch, and would run synchronously until the first `await`. You
probably shouldn't be counting on the executing order of the beginning of async reducers anyway, so
your code is unlikely to break after upgrading to version 4.0.0. But, please run your tests in this
new version and open an issue if it has created any problems for you that you think would make it
difficult to migrate.

<br>

## Deprecated

`StoreConnector`'s `model` parameter is now deprecated. It expects a `BaseModel`
object, which is also deprecated. AsyncRedux run the `BaseModel.fromStore()`
method to obtain yet another object of type `BaseModel`, which is the view-model used by the
connector.

While the `model` parameter is easy to use, it is also easy to use it wrong.

Instead, you should now use the `StoreConnector`'s `vm` parameter to pass an object of
type `VmFactory`. AsyncRedux will run the `VmFactory.fromStore()`
method to obtain an object of type `Vm`, which is now the view-model used by the connector.
Note: `Vm` is immutable, and all its fields must be final.

AsyncRedux will inject the `state` and the `dispatch`/`dispatchFuture` methods into `VmFactory`, so
that you easily can create any fields and methods you need to help you build the view-model.

This is a complete example:

```dart
class MyHomePageConnector extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StoreConnector<AppState, AppEnvironment, ViewModel>(
        vm: () => Factory(this),
        builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel vm) =>
            MyHomePage(
              counter: vm.counter,
              onIncrement: vm.onIncrement,
            ));
  }
}

class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, AppEnvironment, MyHomePageConnector> {
  Factory(widget) : super(widget);

  @override
  ViewModel fromStore() =>
      ViewModel(
        counter: state.counter,
        onIncrement: () => dispatch(IncrementAndGetDescriptionAction()),
      );
}

class ViewModel extends Vm {
  final int counter;
  final String description;

  ViewModel({
    @required this.counter,
    @required this.onIncrement,
  }) : super(equals: [counter]);
}
```

Please note, `StoreConnector`'s `converter` parameter still works and will NOT be deprecated.

<br>

## View-model equality

Just as before, if you provide the `Vm.equals` field in the constructor, it will automatically
create equals/hashcode for you, so that the connector can know when the view-model changed, and
rebuild. However, you can now provide your own comparison method, if you want. To that end, your
state classes must implement the `VmEquals` interface. As a default, objects of type `VmEquals`
are compared by identity, while all other object types are, as usual, compared by equality. You may
then override the `VmEquals.vmEquals()` method to provide your custom comparisons.

## [2.12.2] - 2020/06/30

* Global WrapError now gets error, stackTrace, and action (none of them optional).
* MockStore (still experimental, in `mock_store.dart`), lets you mock or disable actions/reducers
  during tests.
  (See section `Mocking actions and reducers` in README.md).
* ReduxAction.status and ReduxAction.isFinished. (Search for "Action status" in README.md).
* ReduxAction.reduceWithState deprecated (will be removed).

## [2.11.1] - 2020/06/12

* Added cache/reselector functions with 1 or 2 states and zero parameters: `cache1` and `cache2`.
* Breaking change: Other cache/reselector functions are now named `cache1_1`, `cache1_2`, `cache2_1`
  , and `cache2_2`.
* Breaking change: Dispatch/DispatchFuture with `notify: false` will change the state but not
  rebuild widgets.

## [2.10.0] - 2020/06/01

* BaseModel now doesn't give direct access to the store, and doesn't read the state from the store
  anymore. The state is now copied and kept constant in the view-model, as it should.

## [2.9.0] - 2020/05/25

* Stacktrace in WrapError.
* EventMultiple (Event.map).

## [2.8.11] - 2020/05/19

## [2.8.0] - 2020/04/30

* Store.waitCondition() returns a future which will complete when the state meets a given condition.

* Breaking change: StoreTester.waitCondition() now accepts a parameter called testImmediately. When
  testImmediately is true (now the default), it will test the condition immediately when the method
  is called. If the condition is true, the method will return immediately, without waiting for any
  actions to be dispatched. When testImmediately is false (the old behavior), it will only test the
  condition once an action is dispatched.

## [2.7.3] - 2020/04/30
