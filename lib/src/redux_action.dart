  /// can't throw errors. It may be synchronous only.

  /// The `reduce` method is the action reducer. It may read the action state,
  /// the store state, and then return a new state (or `null` if no state
  /// change is necessary).
  ///
  /// It may be synchronous (returning `AppState` or `null`)
  /// or async (returning `Future<AppState>` or `Future<null>`).

  /// The `StoreConnector`s may rebuild only if the `reduce` method returns
  /// a state which is both not `null` and different from the previous one
  /// (comparing by `identical`, not `equals`).

  /// You may wrap the reducer to allow for some pre or post-processing.
  /// For example, if you want to abort an async reducer if the state
  /// changed since when the reducer started:
  /// ```
  /// Reducer<St, Environment> wrapReduce(Reducer<St, Environment> reduce) => () async {
  ///    var oldState = state;
  ///    AppState newState = await reduce();
  ///    return identical(oldState, state) ? newState : null;
  /// };
  /// ```

  /// If any error is thrown by `reduce` or `before`, you have the chance
  /// to further process it by using `wrapError`. Usually this is used to wrap
  /// the error inside of another that better describes the failed action.
  /// For example, if some action converts a String into a number, then instead of
  /// throwing a FormatException you could do:
  ///
  ///     wrapError(error) => UserException("Please enter a valid number.", error: error)
  ///
  /// If you want to disable the error you can return `null`. For example, if you want
  /// to disable errors of type `MyException`:
  ///
  ///     wrapError(error) => (error is MyException) ? null : error
  ///
  /// IMPORTANT: The action [wrapError] behaves differently from the global [WrapError]
  /// because returning `null` will DISABLE the error, while in the global [WrapError]
  /// returning `null` will keep the error unchanged. This difference is confusing,
  /// and I will, in the future, change the global [WrapError] to match the action.
  Object? wrapError(error) => error;

  /// If this returns true, the action will not be dispatched: `before`, `reduce`
  /// and `after` will not be called, and the action will not be visible to the
  /// `StoreTester`. This is only useful under rare circumstances, and you should
  /// only use it if you know what you are doing.

  /// Nest state reducers without dispatching another action.
